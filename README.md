# Team Roster
Anthony Chiu, Tiara Grier,Taylor Lightbourne, Ryan Smith, 

# Collaboration Tools
Our team made use of Visual Studio's Live Share feature to mob code in real time while communicating via Microsoft Teams. Since our team is composed of remote students in different locations, this offered us the best opportunity to code together in real time from our respective homes. We also used Microsoft Teams and joined a group call to communicate with each other in real time. Teams was especially useful as we had one member screenshare; this was helpful as we could detect if there was any issues with Live Share not catching up with any of the edits we were making. 

# Language Selection
Our team used C# since it will be utilized in our team project this semester.
